<p>description: Security and Operations Responsible Disclosure Statement.</p>

<p>At FreightTrust &amp; Clearing, security is a priority. But regardless of how much
effort we put into system security, there may still be vulnerabilities present.
If you discover a vulnerability, we want to know about it so we can take steps
to address it as quickly as possible. We would like to ask you to help us better
protect our clients and our systems.</p>

<h1 id="defect-response">Defect Response</h1>

<p>If you think you have discovered a security issue in any of the Hyperledger
projects, we’d love to hear from you. We will take all security bugs seriously
and if confirmed upon investigation we will patch it within a reasonable amount
of time and release a public security bulletin discussing the impact and credit
the discoverer.</p>

<h2 id="security-bug-handling-process">Security Bug Handling Process</h2>

<div class="important">

- Attempting to Extort or otherwise force monetary compensation is not the best
  way to receive a bug bounty. If the defect is legitmate we will provide
  compensation so long as any report includes a remediation solution only.

- We will NOT disclose to other parties, e.g. colleagues at your employer,
  unless you wish us to.

</div>

<p>The process the Operations Security Team will follow when dealing with security
bugs is detailed below:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The person discovering the issue, the reporter, reports the vulnerability
privately to</li>
</ol>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">admin@freighttrust.com ops@freighttrust.com</code></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Messages that do not relate to the reporting or managing of an undisclosed
security vulnerability in our software are ignored and no further action is
required.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The project team sends an e-mail to the original reporter to acknowledge the
report.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The project team investigates report and either rejects it or accepts it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the report is rejected, the project team writes to the reporter to
explain why.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the report is accepted, the project team writes to the reporter to let
them know it is accepted and that they are working on a fix.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The project team requests a CVE number from security at hyperledger.org by
sending an e-mail with the subject “CVE request for…” and providing a short
(one line) description of the vulnerability. Guidance is available to
determine if a report requires multiple CVEs or if multiple reports should
be merged under a single CVE.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The project team agrees the fix on their private list.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The project team provides the reporter with a copy of the fix and a draft
vulnerability announcement for comment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The project team agrees to the fix, the announcement and the release
schedule with the reporter. For an example of an announcement see Tomcat’s
announcement of CVE-2008-2370. The level of detail to include in the report
is a matter of judgement. Generally, reports should contain enough
information to enable people to assess the risk associated with the
vulnerability for their system and no more. Steps to reproduce the
vulnerability are not normally included.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The project team commits the fix. No reference should be made to the commit
being related to a security vulnerability.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The project team creates a release that includes the fix.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The project team announces the release. The release announcement should be
sent to the usual mailing lists (typically the project’s user list, dev
list, announce list and the Hyperledger announce list).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The project team announces the vulnerability. The vulnerability announcement
should be sent after the release announcement to the following destinations:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>the same destinations as the release announcement</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the vulnerability reporter</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>our github.com/freight-chain/forum or our disqus forums.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="format">Format</h2>

<p>We utilize MITRE Corporations ATT\&amp;CK and CVE Process
<a href="https://cveform.mitre.org/">CVE Form, Mitre.org</a></p>

<p>Submissions should be in the following format</p>
