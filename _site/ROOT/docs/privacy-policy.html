<h2 id="10-controls-for-do-not-track-features">10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>

<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications
include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal
your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities
monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for
recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard
for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform
you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>

<p>Verification process</p>

<p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine
you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These

match it with the information you have previously provided us. For instance,
depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain
information so that we can match the information you provide with the
information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a
communication method (e.g. phone or email) that you have previously provided to
us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.</p>

<p>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your
identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid
requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. If,
however, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already
maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the
purposes of verifying your identity, and for security or fraud-prevention
purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we
finish verifying you.</p>
