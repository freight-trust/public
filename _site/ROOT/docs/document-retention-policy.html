<p>Freight Trust</p>

<p>Records Management Officer</p>

<h1 id="overivew">Overivew</h1>

<p>The corporate information of Freight Trust [and its subsidiaries] is important
to how it conducts business and manages employees.</p>

<p>Federal [and state] law require[s] Freight Trust to retain certain records,
usually for a specific amount of time. The accidental or intentional destruction
of these records during their specified retention periods could result in the
following consequences for Freight Trust and/or its employees:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fines and penalties.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Loss of rights.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obstruction of justice charges.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inference of spoliation of evidence and spoliation tort claims.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contempt of court charges</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Serious disadvantages in litigation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Freight Trust must retain certain records because they contain information that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Serves as Freight Trust’s corporate memory. Has enduring business value (for
example, it provides a record of a business transaction, evidences Freight
Trust’s rights or obligations, protects Freight Trust’s legal interests or
ensures operational continuity).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Must be kept to satisfy legal, accounting, or other regulatory requirements.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Freight Trust prohibits the inappropriate destruction of any records, files,
documents, samples, and other forms of information. This policy is in accordance
with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, under which it is a crime to change,
conceal, falsify, or destroy any record with the intent to impede or obstruct
any official or government proceeding. Therefore, this policy is part of a
company-wide system for the review, retention, and destruction of records
Freight Trust creates or receives in connection with the business it conducts.</p>

<h1 id="reasons-for-policy">REASONS FOR POLICY</h1>

<p>Counsel may consider revising the clause above to include mention of any state
or local law for the jurisdiction(s) where this policy will be used. Also
consider adding examples of records that are specific to the company’s industry
and workplace.</p>

<h2 id="types-of-documents">Types of Documents</h2>

<p>This policy explains the differences among records, disposable information, and
confidential information belonging to others.</p>

<p>Records A record is any type of information created, received, or transmitted in
the transaction of Freight Trust’s business, regardless of physical format.
Examples of where the various types of information are located include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Appointment books and calendars.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Audio and video recordings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Computer programs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contracts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Electronic files.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Emails.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Handwritten notes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Invoices.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Letters and other correspondence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Magnetic tape.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Memory in cell phones and PDAs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Online postings, such as on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Medium, Slack,
Github and other social media platforms and websites.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Performance reviews.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Test samples.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Voicemails.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, any paper records and electronic files, including any records of
donations made online, that are part of any of the categories listed in the
Records Retention Schedule contained in the Appendix to this policy, must be
retained for the amount of time indicated in the Records Retention Schedule. A
record must not be retained beyond the period indicated in the Record Retention
Schedule, unless a valid business reason (or a litigation hold or other special
situation) calls for its continued retention. If you are unsure whether to
retain a certain record, contact the Records Management Officer or the Legal
Department.</p>

<h3 id="disposable-information">Disposable Information</h3>

<p>Disposable information consists of data that may be discarded or deleted at the
discretion of the user once it has served its temporary useful purpose and/or
data that may be safely destroyed because it is not a record as defined by this
policy. Examples may include: image</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Duplicates of originals that have not been annotated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Preliminary drafts of letters, memoranda, reports, worksheets, and informal
notes that do not represent significant steps or decisions in the preparation
of an official record.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Books, periodicals, manuals, training binders, and other printed materials
obtained from sources outside of Freight Trust and retained primarily for
reference purposes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spam and junk mail.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="confidential-information-belonging-to-others">Confidential Information Belonging to Others</h3>

<p>Any confidential information that an employee may have obtained from a source
outside of Freight Trust, such as a previous employer, must not, so long as such
information remains confidential, be disclosed to or used by Freight Trust.
Unsolicited confidential information submitted to Freight Trust should be
refused, returned to the sender where possible, and deleted, if received via the
internet. Mandatory Compliance</p>

<h3 id="responsibility-of-all-employees">Responsibility of All Employees</h3>

<p>Freight Trust strives to comply with the laws, rules, and regulations that
govern it and with recognized compliance practices. All company employees must
comply with this policy, the Records Retention Schedule and any litigation hold
communications. Failure to do so may subject Freight Trust, its employees, and
contract staff to serious civil and/or criminal liability. An employee’s failure
to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary sanctions, including
suspension or termination. Reporting Policy Violations Freight Trust is
committed to enforcing this policy as it applies to all forms of records. The
effectiveness of Freight Trust’s efforts, however, depends largely on employees.
If you feel that you or someone else may have violated this policy, you should
report the incident immediately to your supervisor.</p>

<p>If you are not comfortable bringing the matter up with your immediate
supervisor, or do not believe the supervisor has dealt with the matter properly,
you should raise the matter with the [Records Management Officer/manager at the
next level above your direct supervisor]. If employees do not report
inappropriate conduct, Freight Trust may not become aware of a possible
violation of this policy and may not be able to take appropriate corrective
action. No one will be subject to and Freight Trust prohibits, any form of
discipline, reprisal, intimidation, or retaliation for reporting incidents of
inappropriate conduct of any kind, pursuing any record destruction claim, or
cooperating in related investigations.</p>

<h1 id="mandatory-compliance">MANDATORY COMPLIANCE</h1>

<p>It is important to remind all employees that retaliation of any kind, including
for reporting any type of violation of a policy, is strictly prohibited. For
more information on retaliation generally and how to prevent it, see Practice
Note, Retaliation.</p>

<p>This clause reminds employees to back up files necessary for the company’s
business continuation procedures. Counsel should consider revising the clause to

Department [TITLE]. The destruction of records must stop immediately upon
notification from [the Legal Department] that a litigation hold is to begin
because Freight Trust may be involved in a lawsuit or an official investigation
(see next paragraph). Destruction may begin again once the Legal Department
lifts the relevant litigation hold.</p>

<h2 id="destruction">Destruction</h2>

how the Records Management Officer and other employees should destroy records.
Once an employee destroys a record, he should document its destruction with the
Records Management Officer, the Legal Department and other relevant personnel.
The destruction of electronic records should be coordinated with the IT
department to ensure that all copies of the electronic records are discarded,
including copies residing on backup tapes, temporary files, additional servers,
and all employees’ email in-boxes and other electronic storage locations.</p>

<h1 id="litigation-holds-and-other-special-situations">Litigation Holds and Other Special Situations</h1>

records are relevant to current litigation, potential litigation (that is, a
dispute that could result in litigation), government investigation, audit, or
other event, you must preserve and not delete, dispose, destroy, or change those
records, including emails, until [the Legal Department] determines those
records are no longer needed. This exception is referred to as a litigation hold
or legal hold, replaces any previously or subsequently established destruction
schedule for those records. If you believe this exception may apply, or have any
questions regarding whether it may possibly apply, please contact [the Legal
Department].</p>
