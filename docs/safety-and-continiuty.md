**Fail Safe Mechanism**

Smart contracts may not include appropriate or sufficient backup /
failover mechanisms in case something goes awry.

  - Smart contracts may depend on other systems to fulfill contract
    terms. These other systems may have vulnerabilities that could
    prevent the smart contract from functioning as intended.

  - Some smart contract platforms may be missing critical system
    safeguards and customer protections.

  - Where smart contracts are linked to a blockchain, forks in the chain
    could create operational problems.

  - In case of an operational failure, recourse may be limited or
    non-existent — complete loss of a virtual asset is possible.

  - Poor governance. Smart contracts may require attention, action, and
    possible revision subject to appropriate governance and liability
    mechanisms.
    
      - Low Level Monotiroing of Deployed Contracts (e.g. QuickBlocks)
    
      - Failsafe mechanism to return to us in case of attack or error
    
      - Best Practices
    
      - Auditing by 3rd Party
    
      - Functional Lanaguage Approach to design (e.g. KVM)

# Active Monitoring

# **Smart Contract Monitoring:**

  - Actively monitor one (or more) Ethereum smart contracts and user
    accounts (or any combination) watching for odd or “known-dangerous”
    transactional patterns. Report to anomalies to a list of email, SMS,
    web site, or individuals whenever something of interest happens.

| End Users: | Smart contract developers, smart contract participants (i.e. token holders)                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Notes:     | “Weird” things include recursive attacks, violations of invariants (token balances to ether balance), largest purchases, most active trader accounts, etc.; Could potentially spawn an “insured” smart contract industry expectation. |

**Smart Contract Reporting:**

  - Instantaneous “Quarterly” reports available every second. On demand
    reports generated for cap tables (report on token holders),
    individual ether holdings and transaction histories (i.e. bank
    statements) on a per-account, per-contract-group, by industry, or
    system wide.

| End Users: | Smart contract developers, smart contract participants (i.e. token holders), economists, regulators                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Notes:     | Allows for self-reporting on business processes, expenditures, and revenue from outside an organization—​no need to wait for company reports; marketing efforts might engender an expectation that every smart contract’s accounting is fully transparent. |

**Auditing Support:**

Provide data and transactional information to third parties not
associated with the development team of a smart contract system.
Interesting to potential investors, industry analysts, auditors and/or
regulators.

| Note:      | Fully parsed data makes for much easier auditing of smart contracts, could expose non-delivery of promised behavior (i.e. are “provably true” gambling sites actually paying out at the rate they claim? Gambler Watch™). |
