We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.

Verification process

Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom
we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that
we can match it with the information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request
you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the
information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email)
that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.

We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.
To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. If,
however, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you
provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity, and for security or fraud-prevention purposes.
